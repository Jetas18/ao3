# Chapter 2: Who am I?

Today was quite a day. I met someone who I think is not pathetic and actually good.
I know you might be thinking I use the word pathetic a lot but I just like it.
I say to you as I shout while opening the door to my apartment "Luna!",
a cat with partial white and black fur comes walking from behind the couch meowing,
god I love my cat..

I kneel down as I begin to pet Luna "Hey little girl how was your day??",
I say in a cute voice because like I said I love her but I wont get anything more than a meow,
which is enough to relax me for everything going on her purring is just a medicine that makes me, calm as a hound dog laying in the shade during a sunny day.

I walk to my room as I keep my bag on my bed and keep my diary on my desk.
I never told you my name did I?
I dont think I gave you a name either but who cares atleast you are there listening to me and keeping quiet.
You atleast deserve to know my name so it is Abaddon, no need to think much it, Abaddon is a Hebrew name meaning ruin, destruction.
This statement is a thorny path leading us deeper into the sadness of truth.
because I am the poison that seeps into the veins, corroding and ruining all that is pure.
I ruined everything my parent's marriage, my old friends, my old life I had.
I will tell you about it later because I am the poison-tipped arrow, urging you to refrain from directing your hate towards me, it will just harm us both.

I begin to pour water and food in another bowl for Luna she must be hungry.
I take a seat on the floor next to her.
