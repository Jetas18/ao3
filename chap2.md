# Chapter 2: Let me breathe please Keres

Today was quite a day...

I met someone who ignited a fluttering butterfly symphony within my chest,
their presence dancing delicately on the strings of my heart..

Upon opening the door to my apartment, a burst of excitement erupted from my lips.
"Luna!" I called out, and there she was,
my familiar feline companion with white and black fur,
gracefully strolling over from behind the couch.
Her cute little meows resonated deep within me,
instantly softening my edges and melting away the troubles of the day.

Oh, how I adore my cat.

I kneel down as I begin to pet Luna "Hey little girl how was your day??",
I say in a cute voice I knew I wont get anything more than a meow,
which was always more than enough to relax me for everything going on with me.
Her purring is just a medicine that makes me more calm than anything in the world except maybe Keres- **NO** I can't become like others no!

I never told you my name did I?
I dont think I gave you a name either but who cares atleast you are there listening to me and keeping quiet.
You atleast deserve to know my name so it is Katara.
No need to think much of it,
Katara is a word in greek which just translates to curse.

Indeed, my name reflects what I believe myself to be—a curse.
I have brought ruin upon my parents' marriage, my old friends, and the life I once had.
I have cursed it all. 
But I will reveal more about this later.
For now, I do not wish for you to hate me just yet.

I begin to pour water and food in another bowl for Luna she must be hungry.
I take a seat on the floor next to her as I eat from my own plate of food.

It is time to sleep my favorite part of the day not because I am lazy but because I can control everything there,
this isn't how you usually feel about your dreams,
I don't know if you sleep or not but if you do you must be knowing you can't usually control what you see in a dream.

But you actually can, there are lucid dreams where if you know you are in a dream you can control what you see in it.
Just like everything though it still has a few side effects like:

* Not being able to know if you are in a dream or not basically getting confused between reality and dreams.


* Vivid dreams can wake you and make it hard to get back to sleep.


*  You might not sleep well if you’re too focused on lucid dreaming.


* Can cause hallucinations


Even with all that I still like to have lucid dreams and an easy method I use usually to do so is just trying things that aren't possible in real life.
Like trying to breath through my mouth with it shut tight or try to move my thumb through my palm I used to have more extreme methods but they weren't healthy enough for me to continue...

It's as if the sun has awakened within me, the world has a radiant glow. The comfort in it's warmth is the same one I feel when I hug Luna.

It feels like there is a butterfly dances in the depths of my stomach.

What is this? What is this strange sensation that is consuming me?
I need to breath.
I need to breath. 
As I am chanting that to myself to my self there is a hand that slaps squarely on my back.

It was a familiar hand—one that had greeted me earlier today day with the same firm gesture.

It is Keres. Am I dreaming? Am I awake?
I do not know, but what I do know is that it is Keres's hand resting on my back.

"Hello~! You seem the least pathetic of them all."

It is the same thing she told me today.

Am I losing control over my dreams? What is Keres doing to me?
