# Chapter 2: Who am I?

Today was quite a day...

I met someone who ignited a fluttering butterfly symphony within my chest,
their presence dancing delicately on the strings of my heart..

I shout,"Luna!" as I opened the door to my apartment.
The familiar feline with white and black fur greets me,
strolling over from behind the couch.
Her cute little meows make my edges soften.
God I love my cat...

I kneel down as I begin to pet Luna "Hey little girl how was your day??",
I say in a cute voice I knew I wont get anything more than a meow,
which was always more than enough to relax me for everything going on with me.
Her purring is just a medicine that makes me more calm than anything in the world except maybe Keres- **NO** I can't become like others no!

I never told you my name did I?
I dont think I gave you a name either but who cares atleast you are there listening to me and keeping quiet.
You atleast deserve to know my name so it is Katara.
No need to think much of it,
Katara is a word in greek which just translates to curse.

My name is actually what I am, a curse nothing more nothing less.
I ruined everything my parent's marriage, my old friends, my old life I had, I cursed it all...
I will tell you about it later because I don't want you to hate me yet.

I begin to pour water and food in another bowl for Luna she must be hungry.
I take a seat on the floor next to her as I eat from my own plate of food.

It is time to sleep my favorite part of the day not because I am lazy but because I can control everything there,
this isn't how you usually feel about your dreams,
I don't know if you sleep or not as you are imaginary but if you do you must be knowing you can't usually control what you see in a dream.

But you actually can, there are lucid dreams where if you know you are in a dream you can control what you see in it.
Just like everything though it still has a few side effects like:

* Not being able to know if you are in a dream or not basically getting confused between reality and dreams.


* Vivid dreams can wake you and make it hard to get back to sleep.


*  You might not sleep well if youâ€™re too focused on lucid dreaming.


* Can cause hallucinations


Even with all that I still like to have lucid dreams and an easy method I use usually to do so is just trying things that aren't possible in real life.
Like trying to breath through my mouth with it shut tight or try to move my thumb through my palm I used to have more extreme methods but they weren't healthy enough for me to continue..
