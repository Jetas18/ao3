People. People are pathetic. It wasn't an insult, a slight, or a joke; no, I meant it. Their
smiles, hollow, and that fire in their eyes? Crackling, smouldering, all-consuming. They
were just seeking release. Pathetic. Did they have no other thoughts?

As I pulled out a diary overflowing with sticky notes in all colors of the rainbow, I
started to note my thoughts. I know that precisely this is the reason I have no friends...
but at least I have you, and you are more than enough.

My attention focused on the door to our classroom. Another hormonal-driven husk
entered. They had a name. They had a face. They had hobbies, likes, and dislikes. I
didn't care about any of that. To me, they were just static, characters that existed in
movies to fill the otherwise devoid background, serving to create an illusion of reality.

The tired voice of our teacher came low, masked by the hubbub of trivial conversation.
"You know, you people should at least pretend I am here, even if you idiots are all
failures."

Sighing, I switched out my diary for my class notebook. As I navigated the pages,
guided by my sticky notes, another distinct voice came, this time from outside the door.
"Knock knock," it said playfully. It was that high-pitch voice I always associated with
girls. She punctuated every 'knock' with a knock on the door.

Of course, she couldn't enter; Paul always locked the door when he sauntered into class
with his vast, brown suitcase with all sorts of documents and papers he had prepared
for today's lessons. "Another late student," he proclaimed. Paul paused before
continuing in a much more authoritative voice, "Why not consider coming to class on
time? Maybe you won't find the door locked, then!"

His behavior seemed quite hostile and demeaning, but all teachers I knew were like
that. They just came here, did their job, and thought they were oh so much better than
us students.

Paul fixed us all in a gaze; some conversation stopped while others carried on
undeterred, unrepenting, uncaring. "Please open your books to page 76; today, we'll
be starting a new topic. Namely—"

He didn't get a chance to finish his thoughts, however, as loud muttering came outside
one of the windows opened to the hallway.

A student my age swung inside with surprising grace. I contemplated what lunatic this
now is who enters from the opened window, but that is when I heard his voice. I realized
it wasn't a 'him' at all, but a 'her'! It was the very same voice from outside the door
moment prior. Nothing besides her voice gave it away, really. With long, black
sweatpants and our blue school uniform, which covered her arms to the wrist, you
wouldn't be able to tell her gender. Her face was mischievous, with a devious smirk, as
if she knew a joke no one else did. Whatever they were, they would provide me with
material to bitch about for the rest of the year. What else could they be but a pain in the
arse? Yet, I did have to respect her defiance. She had guts.

Paul, meanwhile, appeared as a boiling kettle, his face red, his brows furrowed. I've
never seen him this angry before, and what shocked me even more was that he threw—
yes, he fucking threw!—his mobile at her.

Yet, with serpentine grace, she swayed out of the mobile's trajectory. An ear-shattering
crack was heard as it impacted against the opposite wall, becoming undone, splintering
into hundreds of glassen shards. Who was she to move like that?

In an act of rebellion, she addressed Paul with that shit-eating grin of hers. "Oh, come
on~! You can be a bit more polite than that!" She put her hands to her cheeks, pouting.
"Oh my! I'm soooo sorry; I didn't introduce myself yet. I am—"

Someone shouted from the back, stealing her thunder. "Someone who nobody cares
about!" Several of his friends began to chime in, laughing and mocking.

I couldn't judge him for those words. I learned early in life that no matter their
pretentious facades, they all care about themselves at the end of the day. They may tell
you, nay, assure you, they'd be there for you, but they really aren't. Everyone is his own
best friend, and no one truly cared about the other. At least, that was how it was here.

"Oh? Is that how your father refers to you? Thank you for telling us."

Silence. Just silence. They obviously didn't know how to rebuke her with her frame tilted
ever so slightly forward, her arms crossed. She knew she had won.
"So... anyways," she continued in a diva's voice, "I am Sarena, thank you very much."
To top it all off, she clapped her hands, continuing further, full of revelry, "I really
appreciate the warm welcome! I am your new classmate. People were just pathetic
back there, but I realise now you are even more pathetic..."

In contrast to her cheerful voice, the words 'pathetic' were uttered as if it were poison on her tongue.

It may seem mean to anyone else, but I had to admit, her calling the others pathetic made me appreciate her.
That's the most attractive thing I have ever heard about anyone's personality.

More so, she walked toward me, slapping her hand squarely on my back.
"Hello~! You seem the least pathetic of them all."
Apparently, she had judged me worth, or at least not as unworthy, and decided to sit beside me, putting her bag next to her chair.

Paul still broiled, but his face clearly stated, 'I don't get paid enough for this shit'.
To confirm that notion, he said as much, then, afterwards, he just taught what he originally intended, integrals. I did hate math, truth be told.

The class continued to snicker and laugh all throughout, but my gaze was as if blinded,
and my ears as if deaf. All my senses circled back to her, as she was the one and only focal point for me.
Her blue eyes were like vast oceans I lost myself in.
She made me
feel warm inside without her even looking at me.
What was this?
Was I becoming like them? I hope not.
Please don't let it be that way.

She taps me on the shoulder, inquiring if our teacher is always this angry.
I couldn't even respond for a solid few seconds as her visage overwhelmed me. What is wrong with me?
I think I understand now, now that I am no longer in class. She isn't as pathetic as I've learned everyone else to be.
